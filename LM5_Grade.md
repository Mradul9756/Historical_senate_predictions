## FEEDBACK
Good job overall, however, the discussion of what costs you picked and why was lacking. Also, an analysis of why the models predicted the way they did would have been good.
1. Described data set (if new)
2. Created a cost matrix for your data set.
3. Evaluated with and without costs
4. Discussion of results
